A not very faithful clone of Drug Wars.

## todo:

* add training for skills
* add weapons (better weapons increase fight skill)
* add weapons shop
* find a better way to handle the passage of time (each activity should consume X hours, possibly random)
* we should show the prices of all items in sale menu, even if we dont have the item.



## bugs to fix:
look at the issues section.
