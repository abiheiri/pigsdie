# Pigs Die!

A not very faithful clone of Drug Wars.

## todo:

* add training for skills
* add weapons (better weapons increase fight skill)
* add weapons shop
* find a better way to handle the passage of time (each activity should consume X hours, possibly random)
* we should show the prices of all items in sale menu, even if we dont have the item.



## bugs to fix:
- You hit one of the officiers!
- Officers left: 0
- Want to keep fighting?
- [y/n]
- y
- Exiting subroutine via redo at ./pigs_die.pl line 396, <> line 17.
- Can't "redo" outside a loop block at ./pigs_die.pl line 396, <> line 17.
